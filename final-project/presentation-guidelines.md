# Final Project Presentations

You will present your project in a five minute presentation to the class. Presentations will occur during class on Monday April 22, and Thursday April 25.

I will publish an order for presentations, so teams know when they're presenting. It won't be available until Monday morning, so be ready to present on Monday.

## Presentation Content

Your presentation should center around a demo of your application

Plan on spending a minute or so discussing your data:
- What do your datasets describe?
- Where did you find them?
- Did you need to do anything special when loading the data?

Then the remainder of your time should be spent doing a quick demo of the application. Remember that you may not have time to demonstrate every feature, so focus on the highlights:
- The main screen/menu: make sure you show us what we'd see when your application initially starts
- Two or three of the more interesting queries

Slides are not required, but having a title page of some kind (even if it's a markdown or text document, or something included in the home screen of your application) might be helpful.

Please **Do Not** plan on demonstrating the data loading functionality of your application. In many cases, it takes significant time, and if something goes wrong, you won't be able to demo the rest of the application.

## Please be ready

- Know when you're presenting. Because of the time constraints, I'll probably have the "on-deck" team assemble in the front during the previous presentation.
- Have your laptop ready
    - Be able to connect an HDMI cable (and know what changes, if any, need to be made)
    - Try to close additional windows, so you're not searching for parts of your presentation
    - Have your application loaded, so you're not trying to enter extra commands.
