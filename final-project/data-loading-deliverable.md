Your submission for the Data-Loading portion of your final project should include the following:

- `load_data.py`: This file should be able to be run (`python3 load_data.py`) to populate the database. It should generate correct results however many times it's run, with no cleanup required in between runs. 
- `datasets.txt`: A text file containing the URL for each of your datasets, one per line. Note that this URL shouldn't be a link to the page with the dataset, it should be the link to the dataset itself. 
- `readme.md`: A readme file containing any other additional instructions, commentary, etc. that you feel is necessary. This should include commands needed to configure the database (which should be minimal).
- Any other files needed by your application. Assume that the datafiles defined in your `datasets.txt` file will be downloaded to the working directory before `load_data.py` is run. (This would include your schema file. It will not be re-graded at this point, but you should still use the latest version.)
