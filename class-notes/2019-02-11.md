# Data Modification (cont'd)

## Dirty Reads in SQL

We can indicate to SQL that dirty reads are acceptable 

`SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED`

Note that we have to specify `READ WRITE` because otherwise, setting the isolation level to `READ UNCOMMITTED` makes the transaction read only by default. 

Other isolation levels:

- `READ COMMITTED` will execute each query using data that was committed before the transaction began. It can change if other transactions commit between executions of a given query
- `REPEATABLE READ` will use a snapshot of the database from when the transaction began. However it's possible the subsequent exectutions of the same query will return "Phantom tuples" that were committed executions
- `SERIALIZABLE` (default)

Postgres doesn't implement `READ UNCOMMITTED` 

# Constraints and Triggers

Constraints and Triggers are both "active" elements: an expression or statement we write once, and store in the database, expecting the element to execute at the appropriate time.

A big problem faced when writing a database application, is that new information can be wrong in a variety of ways. 

We could have our application code validate all input, but it's better to have the database do it:
- Checks aren't forgotten (or bypassed)
- We aren't duplicating code
- We aren't rewriting code

SQL provides a variety of ways for expressing integrity constraints as a part of a database schema. 

## Keys and Foreign Keys

We've already discussed keys: `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`

Foreign keys express referential integrity constraints: the idea that a value that appears in one attribute must also appear in another related place. 

When we declare some set of attributes to be a foreign key, we make two claims:
- The referenced attributes of the second (referenced) relation must be declared `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` 
- The values of the foreign key appearing in the first relation must also appear in the referenced attributes of some tuple in the second (referenced) relation (or be `NULL`).

Two ways to declare, in the `CREATE` or `ALTER` table statement:
- When we declaring an attribute: `attribute TYPE REFERENCES table(attribute)`
- As part of the list of elements to be created: `FOREIGN KEY (attributes) REFERENCES table(attributes)`

```postgresql
CREATE TABLE professor(
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY
);


CREATE TABLE teaching(
  course VARCHAR(255),
  semester CHAR(3),
  professor_email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE REFERENCES professor(email), 
  FOREIGN KEY (course, semester) 
    REFERENCES course(name, semester) 
    ON UPDATE CASCADE 
    ON DELETE SET NULL,
  UNIQUE (course, semester)
);

ALTER TABLE teaching DROP CONSTRAINT teaching_professor_fk;

drop table teaching;

INSERT INTO course(name, semester) VALUES('Art History', 'F19');
INSERT INTO professor VALUES ('Arty', 'prof@example.com');
INSERT INTO teaching(course, semester, professor_email) VALUES('Art History', 'F19', 'prof@example.com');
INSERT INTO teaching(course, semester, professor_email) VALUES('More Art History', 'S20', 'prof@example.com');

SELECT * from teaching;

UPDATE teaching SET professor_email='other@example.com';
DELETE FROM course WHERE name='Art History';
UPDATE course SET name='Better Art History' where name='Art History';

DELETE FROM professor WHERE name='Arty';

```

Once we declare a foreign key, the DBMS will prevent the following:
- INSERT a new tuple whose values for the foreign key are not null or present in the referenced table
- UPDATE the value to one that is not present in the referenced table
- We try to delete the referenced tuple
- We try to update the referenced tuple

For the first two situations, there's no alternative but to reject the change

For the last two situations, there are three approaches that can be taken:
- Default policy: reject the change
- Cascade policy: changes to the referenced attribute are mimicked at the foreign key
- Set-Null policy: changes are allowed. The referring values are set to NULL

```postgresql
ALTER TABLE teaching 
  ADD CONSTRAINT teaching_course_fk FOREIGN KEY 
    (course, semester) REFERENCES course(name, semester)
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
    ON DELETE SET NULL; 

ALTER TABLE teaching ADD CONSTRAINT teaching_professor_fk FOREIGN KEY 
    (professor_email) REFERENCES professor(email)
    ON UPDATE NO ACTION 
    ON DELETE SET NULL;

ALTER TABLE course ADD CONSTRAINT course_teaching_fk FOREIGN KEY (name, semester)
    REFERENCES teaching(course, semester);

ALTER TABLE professor ADD CONSTRAINT professor_teaching_fk FOREIGN KEY (email)
    REFERENCES teaching(professor_email) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED ; 

```

Note on Foreign Keys and Dangling Tuples

Dangling tuples don't participate in a natural join, so dangling tuples are those that would violate a foreign key constraint. 

### Deferred Checking of Constraints

In the case of cicular constraints, we can designate a constraint as `DEFERRABLE`, telling SQL to defer checking the constraint until the transaction commits. 

`DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`

## Constraints on Attributes and Tuples
In a `CREATE TABLE` statement, we can declare two kinds of constraints:
- Constraints on a single attribute
- Constraints on a tuple as a whole 

Simplest single-attribute constraint is `NOT NULL`

### Attribute-based `CHECK` constraint

More complex constraints can be attached to an attribute definition using the `CHECK` keyword

```postgresql
CREATE TABLE financial_aid (
  student VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES student(email),
  semester CHAR(3) NOT NULL,
  amount NUMERIC(8, 2) CHECK ( amount > 0 ),
  taxable_amount NUMERIC(8, 2) ,
  CONSTRAINT financial_aid_taxable_amount_check CHECK (amount >= taxable_amount)
)

```

### Tuple-based `CHECK` constraints

We can add a `CHECK` to the list of elements we declare

Attributes in the CHECK condition are assumed to be about attributes of the table.

Attributes in the CHECK condition that are not attributes of the table must be from a `FROM` subquery

Note that attribute and tuple-based checks are only done when tuples are inserted or updated in the relation where the check is defined.

If they refer to another relation, that relation can be changed without violating the constraint.

If that functionality is needed, use a trigger or assertion. 

## Modifying Constraints

Constraints have names. 

We can define them, or they're provided by SQL

Once they're named, we can modify them.

`ALTER TABLE r DROP CONSTRAINT c` or `ADD CONSTRAINT`

## Assertions

An assertion is a boolean value expression that must be true at all times. 

Postgres doesn't support assertions 

## Triggers 

Sometimes called event-condition-action rules

They differ from the previously discussed constraints:
- Only awakened by certain events, usually inserts, updates, or deletes
- Once awakened, the trigger tests a condition
- If the condition holds, some action is performed
    - Might be something like aborting a transaction or writing to a log table
    - Could potentially be anything

The trigger statement provides for a number of options in the event, condition, and actions parts

Here are the main features:
1. The check of the condition, and the action may be executed on either the state of the database before the triggering event is done, or the state of the database after. 
2. The condition and action can refer to both the old and new values of tuples that were updated in the triggering event 
3. It is possible to define events that are limited to a specific attribute or set of attributes 
4. The programmer has the option of specifying that the trigger executes either:
    - Once for each modified tuple (row-level-trigger)
    - Once for each modifying statement (statement-level-trigger)
