# XML (Continued)

## DTD's (one more thing)

How to use a DTD:

Two approaches:
- Include the DTD itself as a preamble to the XML document 
- In the opening line, refer to the DTD, which must be stored separately in the filesystem, accessible to whatever system is processing the XML document. 

## XML Schemas

They provide an alternative way to define a schema for XML documents

Have some additional capabilities beyond DTDs:
- Restrictions on occurrences of sub-elements
- Declaration of data types 
- Declaration of keys and foreign keys 

An XML schema is an XML document

Namespace: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema 

### Elements

As with DTDs, we need to define the elements that our schema will allow:

Elements have a type

Types may be simple or complex:
- Simple: `xs:string, xs:integer, xs:float`
- Complex: we define ourselves

Complex types come in several forms. The most common is a sequence of elements

We can use `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs` attributes on elements to restrict the number of times the element is allowed or required to appear

There are alternatives to `xs:sequence`:
- `<xs:all>`: every element must occur, in any order, exactly
- `<xs:choice>`: exactly one element must occur

### Attributes

We can define attributes for a complex type

### Restricted Simple Types

We can create a restricted version of a simple type

Used to restrict possible values e.g., min/max, or create enumerated types 

Other restrictions:
- min/max inclusive/exclusive
- enumeration 
- pattern (regex)
- whitespace (preserve, replace, collapse)
- length (minLength/maxLength)
- fractionDigits (number of digits after the decimal)
- totalDigits (number of total digits)

### Keys in XML Schemas

We can use `<xs:key>` elements to declare that certain values of certain elements should be unique across the document

There are two concepts at work:
- Selector: used to define a certain set of elements. 
- Field: the value within the selected element that's unique

We use `<xs:keyref>` to define foreign keys.

```xml
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
    <xs:element name="course-data">
        
    </xs:element>
    <xs:complexType name="semester"></xs:complexType>
    <xs:simpleType name="capacity">
        <xs:restriction base="xs:integer">
            <xs:minExclusive value="0"/>
            <xs:maxInclusive value="500"/>
        </xs:restriction>
    </xs:simpleType>
    <xs:simpleType name="major">
        <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
            <xs:enumeration value="CSCI"/>
            <xs:enumeration value="MATH"/>
        </xs:restriction>
    </xs:simpleType>
    <xs:element name="course">
        <xs:complexType>
            <xs:attribute name="name" type="xs:string" use="required"/>
            <xs:attribute name="semester" type="semester" use="required"/>
            <xs:attribute name="capacity" type="capacity" use="optional"/>
            <xs:sequence>
                    <xs:element name="time" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="3"/>
                    <xs:element name="location" type="xs:string"/>
                    <xs:element name="textbook" type="xs:string" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
            </xs:sequence>
        </xs:complexType>
    </xs:element>
    <xs:key name="course-key">
        <xs:selector xpath="/course-data/courses/course"/>
        <xs:field xpath="@name"/>
        <xs:field xpath="@semester"/>
    </xs:key>
    <xs:keyref name="student-course-ref" refer="course-key">
        <xs:selector xpath="/course-data/students/student/courses-attended/course"/>
        <xs:field xpath="@name"/>
        <xs:field xpath="@semester"/>
    </xs:keyref>
</xs:schema>

# Programming Languages for XML

3 Basic/Main languages:
- XPath: simple language for describing sets of paths
- XQuery: an extension of XPath, providing some SQL-like capabilities
- XSLT: Extensible Stylesheet Language for Transformations
    - Allows creation of templates/stylesheets that define how to process an XML document 
    - Turing complete
    - Declarative, not procedural 
    
## XPath

XPath is a data model

In the relational model, everything is a bag of tuples

In XPath, everything is a sequence of items 

An item is one of:
1. A value of primitive type (int, float, boolean, string)
2. A node. There are many types of nodes. We'll focus on 3:
    - Documents: files containing XML (local path, or URL)
    - Elements: XML elements, including the opening and closing tags, and everything in between
    - Attributes: found inside XML tags for elements
    
Items of a sequence do not all need to be of the same type (though they often are)

### Document nodes

Every XPath query refers to a document

We sometimes use the expression `doc(location)` where location is a file path or URL

### XPath Expressions

Typically start at the document root and give a sequence of tags and slashes

`/T1/T2/.../Tn`

We process the expression in order, from left to right, each step works with the output of the previous step. 

To process `Ti`:
- start with the sequence of items produced by `Ti-1`
- Examine each itme in order
- Accept all items whose tag matches `Ti`

Special case: `/T1`. It will give the single root element. This is distinct from the single document node

`/course-path` is different from `doc('course-data.xml')`

#### Relative Paths

XPath expressions can be relative to the current node (or sequence of nodes)

Relative expressions don't start with a slash

#### Attributes in XPath Expressions

Denoted by the `@`: `/T1/T2/.../Tn/@A`

### Axes

So far, we've only navigated from a node to its child or attribute: a single axis

XPath provides a number of axes for travel, two of which are child and attribute

We use `::` to specify the axis

`/child::T1/child::T2/.../child::Tn/attribute::A`

Other axes:
- child (default)
- attribute `@`
- parent `..`
- ancestor
- descendant
- next-sibling
- previous-sibling 
- self `.`
- descendant-or-self `//`

### Context of Expressions

All components of an XPath expression is executed in some context (otherwise axes--like parent--would no meaning)

### Wildcards

We can use `*` to mean any tag.

We use `@*` to mean any attribute

### Conditions in XPath expressions

We can follow a tag with square brackets enclosing a condition (boolean expression)

That limits the XPath to only tags that meet the condition

Operators: `= != < <= > >= OR AND`

Other useful conditions:

`[i]` is the ith child of its parent

A tag `[t]` by itself is true only for elements that have one or more sub-elements of type `t`

An attribute by itself `[@A]` is true only for elements that have a value for that attribute

There are also some functions like `last()` and `position()`

```xml
<course-data>
    <courses>
        <course>
            <time>MR8-10</time>
        </course>
        <course name="Database Systems" semester="S19">
            <time>MR4-6</time>
            <location>DCC 318</location>
            <students>
                <student id="alice1">alice</student>
            </students>
        </course>
        <course name="Database Systems" semester="F18" capacity="25">
            <time>W6-9</time>
            <location>Low 3039</location>
        </course>
        <course name="Operating Systems" semester="S19">
            <time>MR10-12</time>
            <location>DCC 308</location>
            <students>
                <student id="alice3">alice</student>
            </students>
        </course>
    </courses>
    <students>
        <student name="alice" id="alice1">
            <email>alice@example.com</email>
            <courses-attended>
                <course name="Database Systems" semester="F18"/>
                <course name="Operating Systems" semester="F19"/>
            </courses-attended>
        </student>
        <student name="bob" id="bob1">
            <email>bob@example.com</email>
            <courses-attended>
                <course name="Operating Systems" semester="F19"/>
            </courses-attended>
        </student>
    </students>
</course-data>
```

## XQuery

XQuery is a functional language that's an extension of XPath

Consists of FLWR statements: For, Let, While, Return 

``` 
let $courses := doc('courses.xml')
for $course in $courses
where $course/@semester = 'S19'
return $course/@name 
```

## XSLT

eXtensible Stylesheet Language for Transformations

Procedural language (turing complete)

``` 
<xsl:template match="XPath Expression">
    Some output
    <xsl:valueOf select="XPath Expressions"/>
</xsl:template>

<xsl:template match="/course-data/courses/course">
    Name: <xsl:valueOf select="@name"/>
</xsl:template>
```
