# Query Optimization (cont'd)

## Laws for relational algebra (Logical Query Plans)

### Selection 

Pushing selection through binary operators

1. For Union, the selection must be pushed to both arguments 
2. For a difference, the selection must be pushed to the first argument, optionally to the second
3. For other operators, it's only required to push to one argument
    - In some cases, the selection condition might not apply

It's sometimes necessary to push a selection up a tree and then back down all possible paths. 

### Projection

Similar to pushing selection

However, a projection often also stays where it is. 

Projection is less useful, because it doesn't reduce the number of tuples
- In some cases, it can make the tuples larger

For extended projection: E -> x

Attributes in E are called "input attributes"

Attributes in x are "output attributes"

If a project has only single attributes (no expressions), we say it's a *simple projection*

We may introduce a projection anywhere in the tree as longas it eliminates that are neither used by an operator above, nor appear in the final output

We can push a projection below a selection, as long as we don't project out the attributes in the condition

### Products and Joins

Both are commutative and associative

R Join c S = Select c (R x S)

R Natural Join S = Project L ( Select c (R x S)) where c equates every pair of attributes with the same name, and L contains every attribute in c, and the non-paired attributes 

### Duplicate Elimination

Duplicate elimination can be push through many, but not all operators

Sometimes, it can be removed altogether

d(R) = R, if R has no duplicates 

d(R x S) = d(R) x d(S)

The same holds for joins (natural and theta)

d(Select c (R)) = Select c(d(R))

We can also move it to either argument (or both) of an intersection

### Grouping and Aggregation

Applicability of many transformations depends on the aggregate operators. Few general laws apply as with other operators

Grouping always absorbs duplicate elimination

d(g L (R)) = g L (R)

We can also always project away useless attributes before grouping

Some aggregations (Min, Max) are not impacted by duplicate removal

However, Count, Sum, Avg are all impacted by duplicate removal 

g L (R) = g L (d(R)) only if L contains only Min and Max aggregates

## Parse trees to Logical Query Plans 

Two basic steps:
1. Replace the nodes and structure of the parse tree, in appropriate groups, with expressions of relational algebra
2. Take the relational algebra expression produced by the first step, and turn it into an expression that we expect can be converted into the most efficient physical query plan. 

### Conversion to Relational Algebra

The first rule allows us to convert all "simple" SELECT-FROM-WHERE queries to relational algebra directly

We can replace them as follows (from the bottom to top):
1. The product of all relations mentioned in the <FromList>
2. The selction on condition c, which is the <Condition>
3. A projection, where L is the list of attributes in <SelList>

Removing Subqueries is more complicated

Introduce a new operator, called *two-argument selection*.

Represented as Select with no parameters 

Two children in the logical query plan tree:
- Left represents the relation on which the selection is being performed
- Right is an expression for the condition being applied to each tuple of the relation

![]

We need to define rules that allow us to replace a two-argument selection with a one-argument selection and other operations.

Each form of condition may require its own rules.

In common situations, it might be completely replaced, but sometimes it needs to be left in place. 

Rule for the IN operator, for uncorrelated subqueries:

We have a two-argument selection between R and the condition t IN s, where S is an uncorrelated subquery, and t is a tuple composed of attributes of R.

Transform as follows:

1. Replace <condition> by the expression for S
    - If S may have duplicates, add a duplicate elimination at the root of s
2. Replace the Select with Select c, where c is the condition that equates each element of t to the corresponding attribute of s
3. Give Select c an argument that is R x S

The strategy is more complicated when translating correlated subqueries, because the subqueries can't be translated in isolation.

## Improving the logical query plan

We convert the parse tree to a logical query plan to obtain one possible plan 

We can rewrite that plan using the rules outlined above
- Optionally generate more than one plan
- Different choices for ordering joins/unions/etc
- Typically we're looking for the cheapest physical query plan

### Most commonly used optimizations

- Selections can be pushed down the tree as far as they'll go
    - They can be split and each piece pushed separately 
    - Probably the most effective technique 
- Projections can be pushed down or added
- Duplicate eliminations can be removed, or moved to a more advantageous position
- Certain selections can be combined with a product below to turn the pair of operations into an equijoin

### Grouping Associative/Commutative Operators

An operator that is associative and commutative may be thought of as having any number of operands

We are free to re-order and group these operands

For each portion of the subtree that consists of nodes of same associative and commutative operator, we group them into a single node with many children. Then

1. Replace natural joins with theta joins that equate attributes with the same name
2. Add a projection to eliminate copies of attributes with the same name
3. Theta-join conditions must be associative 

# Coping with System Failures

*Resilience* is the integrity of the data when the system fails in some way

Principle technique supporting resilience is the log

3 different styles of logging (that we'll discuss):
- Undo
- Redo
- Undo/Redo

## Failures

4 Main failure modes

**Erroneous data entry**

Some are impossible to detect (wrong phone number) 

But generally are avoided using Checks/Constraints

**Media Failures**

Local failures are handled by checksums

Disk failure handled by 
- RAID
- Maintain an archive (periodically updated, stored a safe distance away)
- Redundant copies kept online 

**Catastrophic Failure**

Floods, fires, vandalism

RAID doesn't usually help here 

Other techniques for Media Failures usually are 

**System Failures**

Causes the transaction state to be lost

Typically caused by power failures or software errors

## Transactions

The transaction is the unit of execution of database operations.

It can be ad-hoc (just issuing commands)

Or explicit (`BEGIN`/`ROLLBACK`/`COMMIT`)

A transaction must execute atomically: all or nothing, as if it were done in a moment of time

### Correctness

What does it mean for a transaction to execute correctly?

Assume a database is composed of elements:
- Relations
- Disk Blocks
- Individual Tuples (or objects)

It's helpful to assume Disk Blocks. Elements are move to and from Main Memory as single units. 

A database also has *state*, a value for each of its elements

*Consistent* states satisfy all constraints of the database schema

Fundamental assumption for transactions:

If a transaction executes, in the absence of other transactions or system errors, and it starts with the database in a consistent state, then it will be in a consistent state when it ends.

### Operators

Primitive operators of transactions

3 address spaces to consider:
- Space of disk blocks holding DB element
- Main memory, managed by the buffer manager
- Local address space of the Transaction 

For a transaction to read an element, it must first be brought to main memory, if it's not already there. Then it can be read into the Transaction address space. 

An element may or may not be written to disk immediately. 

We'll define transaction operators:
- Input(X): copy the disk block with X to main memory
- Read(X, t): read X from main memory into transaction variable t
- Write(X, t): writes the value from transaction variable t to X in main memory
- Output(X): writes the memory buffer containing X to disk

Example:

``` 
a := a * 2
b := b * 2

Action      t       MemA    MemB    DiskA   DiskB
--------------------------------------------------
                                    5       8
Input(a)            5               5       8
Input(b)            5       8       5       8
Read(a, t)  5       5       8       5       8
a := a*2    10      5       8       5       8
Write(a, t) 10      10      8       5       8
Read(b, t)  8       10      8       5       8
b := b*2    16      10      8       5       8
Write(b, t) 16      10      16      5       8
Output(a)   16      10      16      10      8
Output(b)   16      10      16      10      16



```

## Logging

A log is a file of log records

Imagine a log as a file opened for append only

As the transaction executes, the Log Manager will record important events 

Log records have several forms:

- Start T: transaction T started
- Commit T: transaction T was committed and will make no further changes to the database (however, we can't enforce this)
- Abort T: transaction T could not complete successfully.
    - It's the job of the transaction manager to make sure the changes of T never appear on disk
- Update<T, X, v>: Transaction T changed X for value v

## Undo Logging

Undo logging repairs database damage by rolling back transactions that didn't complete before the crash. 

Rules:
- If transaction T modifies X, the log <T, X, v> must be written disk *before* the new value is written to disk 
- If a transaction commits, then its COMMIT reocrd must be written to disk only *after* all its changes have been written to disk

Add an additional Transaction operator: FLUSH LOG

``` 
a := a * 2
b := b * 2

Action      t       MemA    MemB    DiskA   DiskB   Log
-------------------------------------------------------
                                    5       8       Start T
Input(a)            5               5       8
Input(b)            5       8       5       8
Read(a, t)  5       5       8       5       8
a := a*2    10      5       8       5       8
Write(a, t) 10      10      8       5       8       <T, a, 5>
Read(b, t)  8       10      8       5       8
b := b*2    16      10      8       5       8       
Write(b, t) 16      10      16      5       8       <T, b, 8>
Flush Log
Output(a)   16      10      16      10      8
Output(b)   16      10      16      10      16
                                                    Commit T
Flush Log 

```

### Recovery

Start at the beginning of the log

Ignore all committed transactions

From the end of the log, for every update statement that's part of an uncommitted transaction, replace X with v (the old value)

We add Abort T statement to the log for every uncommitted transaction.


## Checkpointing

Checkpointing keeps the log from growing too big

- Wait for all current transactions to finish
- Stop new transactions from starting
- Flush Log
- Write CHECKPOINT to the log
- Flush Log 
- Resume new Transactions


A drawback to checkpointing is that you have to stop new transactions

*Nonquiescent checkpointing* doesn't require a shutdown of the database.

- Write Start CKPT(Tx1, 2, 3, ... Txk) for all active transactions 
- Wait until every transaction in the list completes 
- End CKPT

### Recovery

- Work backwards, undoing as we go 
- If we encounter END CKPT, we only go back to the previous START CKPT.
- Otherwise, we only go back until we find the start of the earliest transaction in the list.
