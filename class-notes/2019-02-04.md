# SQL Queries

We saw some of SQL back in chapter 2, creating tables: Data-Definition Language 

SQL also supports querying and modifying the data: Data-Manipulation Language

## Simple Queries in SQL

Most basic queries ask for tuples of some relation that satisfy some basic condition

`SELECT * FROM relation WHERE condition`

`FROM` clause specifies the relation

`WHERE` clause defines a condition, similar to the selection operator in relational algebra

`SELECT` clause specifies which attributes, similar to the projection operator

It's often helpful when examining a query to start with the `FROM` clause and then look at the `WHERE` clause, and finally the `SELECT` clause.

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM course
WHERE semester='S19';
```

### Projection in SQL

We use the `SELECT` keyword to accomplish project ion

Use `*` or define a list of elements

Includes extended projection operator:

`SELECT x AS y`

`SELECT 'constant'`

`SELECT x*y AS z, 'string'||'concatentation'` 

```postgresql
SELECT name || ' ' || location AS course_info
FROM course
WHERE semester='S19';

SELECT 1;


```

### Selection in SQL

The selection operator is available via the `WHERE` clause

Six comparison operators: `= <> < > <= >=`

The values we compare are constants and attributes from the relations mentioned in the `FROM clause`

Arithmetic operators: `+ - * / ()`

String concatenation: `||`

The result of a comparison is a boolean: `TRUE` or `FALSE`

We can combine operations using `AND` `OR` `NOT`

#### Strings

Strings are compared and matched exactly 

Padding (from fixed length fields) is ignored 

Comparison `<` or `>` is done using lexicographic order 

#### Pattern Matching 

Exact matching for strings is limiting

SQL allows for Pattern Matching: `s LIKE P` where `s` is a string, and `P` is a pattern

`%` is a wildcard that matches any number of characters

`_` is a wildcard that matches any single character 

`s NOT LIKE P` for the inverse

```postgresql
SELECT * 
FROM course
WHERE location LIKE 'DCC%' 
AND semester LIKE '_19';

INSERT INTO course(name, semester, location)
VALUES ('Calculus 1', 'S19', 'DCC-308'); 

```

**Escaping**

SQL doesn't define a default escape character 

We can choose any character as the escape character

`%%`, '%asdf%'

`s LIKE 'xx%%xx%' ESCAPE 'xx'`

### Dates and Times

Most implementations are fairly flexible on formats for dates and times

SQL Standard is more specific

`DATE'YYYY-MM-DD'` is the standard date format

`TIME'HH:MM:SS.sss'` is the standard time

Arbitrary precision for seconds 

Optionally add a timezone `-H:MM`

We can combine the date and time to form a `TIMESTAMP`

Some implementations use `DATETIME` instead and have different meaning for `TIMESTAMP`

Postgres also has the `INTERVAL` type for comparison

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM enroll
WHERE registered < '2019-01-10';

```

### Null values in SQL

Many reasons to support the concept of NULL

- Value Unknown (birthday)
- Value Inapplicable (spouse for a single person)
- Value withheld (unlisted phone)

SQL Outer Joins also produce null values

Certain insert operations produce null values 

Two important rules to remember when operating on potentially null values:
- When we operate on a `NULL` with arithmetic operators, the result null 
- When we compare a `NULL` to any other value (include `NULL`), the result is `UNKNOWN` 

`NULL` may appear as a value, but we can't operate on it as such

To check for `NULL`: `x IS NULL` (or `x IS NOT NULL`)

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM course
WHERE time IS NOT NULL ;
```

#### Truth values with Unknown

It's helpful to think of `TRUE=1`, `FALSE=0`, and `UNKNOWN=1/2`

- `AND` of any two values, the result is the minimum 
- `OR` of any two values, the result is the maximum
- `NOT` of any value is 1 - the value

### Ordering output

We can specify `ORDER BY <list of attributes>` to sort the output

The default ordering is `ASC`, we can optionally change it to `DESC`

```postgresql
SELECT location
FROM course
ORDER BY name DESC;
``` 

Sorting is done after the `FROM` and `WHERE` clause have executed, but before the `SELECT`

That means that any attributes from the relations in the `FROM` are available to sort, even if they're not in the `SELECT`

We can also order by expression: `ORDER BY last_name || ', ' || first_name`

## Queries involving more than one relation

Much of the power of relational algebra comes from being able to combine two or more relations

We can do that in SQL

### Products and Joins

Simplest approach is to list multiple relations in the `FROM` clause

Effectively gives us a product

We can use the `WHERE` clause to give us a theta-join 

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM course all_courses, enroll
WHERE name = course_name AND all_courses.semester = enroll.semester;

```

Same as with relational algebra, we disambiguate using the name of the relation and a `.`

We also have the option to specify an alias (called a tuple variable)

#### Tuple variables

Sometimes we want to use the same relation multiple times in the `FROM` clause

We disambiguate by using a *tuple variable*

Each use of the relation is followed by a variable that can be used to reference that instance of the relation in the rest of the query


```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM student s1, student s2
WHERE s1.major = s2.major;
```

### Interpreting multi-relation queries

There are a few ways we can think of the select-from-where expressions

#### Nested Loops

Each tuple variable loops over the tuples in the relation

If there are multiple relations, we use nested loops

``` 
for tuple c in course;
    for tuple e in enroll:
       if (where condition)
          print(c, e)
```

#### Parallel Assignment 

Rather than nested loops, we consider in parallel, all possible assignments from the relations to the tuple variables, and we evaluate the WHERE clause for each

#### Conversion to Relational Algebra

Start with relations from the tuple variables. Take Cartesian Product, and apply there WHERE clause using selection

#### Unintuitive consequence

Assume relations R, S, and T each of which has one attribute A 

We want to find all the values that are in both R and either S or T

R INTERSECT (S UNION T)

``` 
SELECT R.A
FROM R, S, T
WHERE R.A=S.A OR R.A=T.A
```

What happens when T is empty?

Nested loops:

``` 
for r in R:
    for s in S:
        for t in T:
            if r.A=s.A or r.A=t.A
                print (r.A)

```

Inner loop never executes, so it produces no results

Parallel assignment:

No combination of a tuple from r, s, and t exists

Relational Algebra:

R x S x T is empty 

### Set operators in Queries

SQL supports the set operators:

`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT` 

The two select statements must produce the same number of attributes and corresponding data types

```postgresql
(SELECT email FROM student) INTERSECT (SELECT student_email FROM enroll);

```

Postgres also allows `UNION ALL` (and `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT`) that does not remove duplicates, which is considerably faster. 

## SubQueries

A query can be used in various to help in the evaluation of another. This called a *subquery*.

We've already seen one example with set operators

Three main others:
1. Subqueries that return a single constant, which can be compared with another constant (or component of a tuple)
2. Subqueries that return a relation that can be used in various ways in the WHERE clause
3. Subqueries that return a relation that can be used in the FROM clause, followed by a tuple variable

### Subqueries that produce scalar values

An atomic value that can appear as one component of a tuple is called a *scalar*.

A select-from-where queries can produce any number of attributes, and any number of tuples

We often only care about one attribute

We can use keys to limit the result to a single tuple 

We can use that kind of query, surrounded by parentheses, as if it were a constant or scalar.

Example: write a query to find all students who took a class last semester that's in the same location as database systems this semester:

```postgresql
SELECT student_email
FROM enroll, course 
WHERE enroll.semester=course.semester AND enroll.course_name=course.name
AND course.semester='F18' AND location=(
  SELECT location 
  FROM course
  WHERE semester = 'S19' AND name='Database Systems'
);

```

### Conditions involving relations 

There are SQL operators we can apply to a relation R and produce a boolean result 

R must be expressed as a subquery 

`(SELECT * FROM R) r` can be a subquery 

1. `EXISTS R`: true if R is not empty 
2. `s IN R`: true if s is equal to one or more values in R
3. `s > ALL R`: true if s is greater than all the values in R
4. `s > ANY R`: true if s is greater than any value in R

All can be negated with `NOT`

```postgresql
SELECT student_email
FROM enroll
WHERE (course_name, semester) NOT IN (
  SELECT course_name, semester
  FROM course
  WHERE location like 'DCC%'
);
```

### Conditions involving Tuples

A tuple in SQL represented as a parenthesized list of scalar values

If a tuple t has the same number of components as the relation R, then we can compare t to R using the operators above

Note that the order of attributes is assumed

Many queries written with subqueries can be rewritten using multiple relations in the FROM clause
