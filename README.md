# Database Systems

Course content, notes, assignments, etc. for my Spring 2019 Database Systems class.

### Welcome

Welcome to ITWS 4960/6960 Database Systems. Take some time to read through the [syllabus](syllabus.md).

## Announcements

**Monday January 14:** I've posted [some notes](postgresql-examples/db-setup.md) to get you started with installing and running PostgreSQL, the database system we'll be using in class throughout the semester. While you won't need it for a few more weeks, it might be helpful to have in class today, and it's certainly better to get it installed now, so you're not scrambling later.

## Git

As I mentioned in the first class, this course uses a git repository rather than a traditional website. The goal is both to make it easy for you to retrieve correct copies of sample code and homework (much of which will involve runnable code) and to help you become familiar with a tool that's widely used in both academia and industry. 

If you're not familiar with git, take an hour and familiarize yourself with it. There are some good resources [here](https://try.github.io/). *This isn't a requirement&mdash;it will be possible to successfully complete this course without a working knowledge of git. But you'll need to learn it eventually anyway, so why not now.*

### Git-related course policies

One of the side effects of using git is that it becomes easy for students to help correct errors (or make suggestions) in any of the content hosted here. If you find an error (typo, bug, other mistake, etc.), feel free to fork the repository, and make a pull request (I believe GitLab calls it a "merge request").

Some of the homework assignments or sample code will become visible in branches throughout the semester before it's technically assigned. If it's in the repo, feel free to look at it. But until I merge it into the `master` branch, everything is still subject to change without notice. If you start a homework assignment early, be sure to check back for changes (which git makes easy to do).
